## Scheduling: recency + "work-on-these-today" intake (2026-08-11)
Request: (1) recently-added due-today items must bubble into today's schedule (recency not burying them
under old priorities); (2) when the user signals "work on these today", schedule within appropriate
windows first and treat overflow as FLEXIBLE — displacing lower-priority ORIGINAL board items — instead
of pushing the signaled items to another day; stated priority must still have bearing. Fix the "Add a
task for today" button double-booking + un-blocked external events.

- [DONE] parse_and_create_tasks dryRun 1:1 harness (commit 8d70611) — reproduces the real button flow zero-write.
- [DONE] Conflict-aware apply, flag-gated `conflictAware:true` (commits 4ef7b8c + 0d9bb68), deployed live.
  Windows-first → flexible-today → displace strictly-lower-priority originals; external events inviolable;
  no double-booking; end_time always set; dryRun zero-write. Proven live via pg_net dryRun + overlap SQL
  (overlapping_tasks/events/placed all 0). Independent verifier spawned to confirm.
- [OPEN] Turn the flag ON in the UI (QuickTaskInput → pass conflictAware:true) once the user confirms the
  live before/after looks right — awaiting user sign-off (they wanted to SEE expected outputs first).
- [OPEN/follow-on] Parser assigns LOW to unqualified "add for today" items → they won't displace existing
  MED originals on plain phrasing. To make "signaled for today = displaces lower originals" work without
  explicit priority words, raise priority for button-signaled items (parser or QuickTaskInput).
- [OPEN] Composite scoring switch in nightly-schedule-builder (commit 925d9df) for the recency-bubbling
  half — validated earlier; awaiting user sign-off to make default.
