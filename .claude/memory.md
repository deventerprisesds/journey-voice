# Project Memory — journey-voice
Last updated: 2026-07-31

## Purpose
journey is the primary life-assistant app (voice + chat, Iris the voice agent). It owns the OUTBOUND
half of the journey→Huddle task-sync mirror (see `CLAUDE.md`), and its `RealtimeVoiceAssistant.ts` is
the org's reference implementation for a live, barge-in voice agent.

## Voice architecture — OpenAI Realtime + ElevenLabs voices DO compose (reference impl lives HERE)
`src/utils/RealtimeVoiceAssistant.ts` is the canonical example, referenced across the org (Huddle's 1:1
`useVoiceCallRealtime.ts` is a lighter variant). The key fact, often re-litigated: you are NOT forced to
choose between OpenAI Realtime and your own ElevenLabs voices. Only OpenAI's *native end-to-end
speech-to-speech* is OpenAI-voice-only. Iris runs both together:

- **Realtime in text mode** — `modalities:['text']`; OpenAI generates the reply as **text**, not native
  speech-to-speech audio.
- **OpenAI's own audio track is muted** — `RealtimeVoiceAssistant.ts:~598` comments "OpenAI still sends
  audio via RTC track even with modalities:['text']" and disables that track in ElevenLabs mode.
- **Native turn-taking + barge stay OpenAI's** — on `input_audio_buffer.speech_started` it sends
  `response.cancel` (`:~897`) + `pauseAgendaForTangent`. Real interruption, not a freeze/re-speak hack.
- **ElevenLabs voices the text** — on `response.text.done` → `playElevenLabsAudio(text)` → the
  `elevenlabs-tts` edge function with that agent's `elevenlabsVoiceId` → MP3 → a **unified audio queue**
  that plays both OpenAI PCM and ElevenLabs MP3 sequentially.
- The `ttsProvider: 'openai' | 'elevenlabs'` field selects the path; server sends `tts_config` with the
  provider + `elevenlabs_voice_id`.

**The "one voice per session / voice can't change mid-session" limit is MOOT** in this pattern — the
voice comes from ElevenLabs per `playElevenLabsAudio` call, not the Realtime session — so distinct
per-agent voices are free. `gpt-realtime-2` (May 2026) did not change the native-S2S-is-OpenAI-voice-only
constraint. (OpenAI's own docs 403 the CCR WebFetch tool; confirm Realtime specifics by reading this
file / the SDK source, not web search alone.)

**Two roles Realtime can play — pick deliberately:**
- **AS BRAIN** (what Iris does here): the Realtime model generates the reply from its own
  instructions/thread. Lowest latency, but it REPLACES any app-side routing/snapshot/owner-awareness.
- **AS EAR ONLY** (Huddle `useVoiceCallRealtime`): `create_response:false` — Realtime does VAD/STT/barge
  only and never generates a reply; every utterance routes through the app's OWN pipeline (semantic
  router + agent snapshot + tools), ElevenLabs voices it. Keeps all app-side intelligence. Choose this
  when routing/snapshots/ownership must be preserved (Huddle's multi-agent ceremony needs this).
